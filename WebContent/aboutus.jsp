<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<br>
The reason behind creating this website is to built the missing gap between the people and the lack of knowledge that is provided to dispose these electronic wastes.This website will not only help people to dispose unused E-waste but also prevents the damage to environment.	We are recycling the old electronics which will help recover valuable materials to make new products. By doing so, we are not only saving energy and reducing pollution but also saving natural resources.
